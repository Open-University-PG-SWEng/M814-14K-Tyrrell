REQ-ID:NFR010
Description:The system must ensure the user has authorisation to update therapist schedules.  Priveleges to update therapist schedules should only be available to Therapists, Receptionists and Office Managers.
Type: 15a Security Requirements/Access Requirements
Rationale: Therapist schedules should not be editable by any other than authorised staff of the clinic.  Vectors allowing abuse to the appointments schedule should be minimised.
Fit Criterion:  For 20 attempts by users without correct priveleges, or external parties not authorised by the system, to update therapist schedules there shall be zero successes.
Originator: Iain Sproat
History:
v1.0 created
v2.0 revised fit criterion to focus on testing through attacks to the system.
v3.0 Changed type to match Volere sub-categories
v4.0 Reduced number of attempts in fit criterion from 100 to 20 to reflect the project being in the environment of a small clinic and the cost of undertaking extensive testing, weighted against the need to ensure compliance of the requirement.

[Iain Sproat] complementary to functional requirement REQ-ID 020 : The system shall allow time periods for availability of therapists to be customised



[prem bhatkar] fit criterion to to me.
[Andy Russell] ok by me.
[Iain Sproat] The above comments related to v1.0.
[Steven Smith]  What assumptions made you decide on 100 attempts?
[Darren Bates] Fine by me
[Dean Armitage] Nothing further to add
[Alvaro Acevedo] Clear description/rational and fit criterion is testable
[Steven Malley] Seems good to me.
[Emma Hastings] Good fit criteron, have to admit I didnt know what vectors meant which may need clarifying to avoid a misunderstanding.
[Lisa Li] Nothing further to add.
[Joseph Souter] Description is good, clearly states who should have privileges. 100 Attempts in a test seems extreme here. This level of testing could lead to an extreme test length.
[Iain Sproat] The above comments related to v3.0
[Mohammed Ngum] Fit criterion looks good. But I also don't know what you mean by vectors.
[Iain Sproat] The use the word 'vector' in the above is in the context of attack surfaces: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface
[Gerard Corrigan] The description suggests more than one requirement.
[Shunsuke Yanome] Fit criterion is ok. I am not sure why 20 attempts?
