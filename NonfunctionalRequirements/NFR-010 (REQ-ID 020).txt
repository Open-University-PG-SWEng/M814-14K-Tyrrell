REQ-ID:NFR010
Description:The system must ensure the user has authorisation to update therapist schedules.  Priveleges to update therapist schedules should only be available to Therapists, Receptionists and Office Managers.
Type: 15a Security Requirements/Access Requirements
Rationale: Therapist schedules should not be editable by any other than authorised staff of the clinic.  Vectors allowing abuse to the appointments schedule should be minimised.
Fit Criterion:  For 100 attempts by users without correct priveleges, or external parties not authorised by the system, to update therapist schedules there shall be zero successes.
Originator: Iain Sproat
History:
v1.0 created
v2.0 revised fit criterion to focus on testing through attacks to the system.
v3.0 Changed type to match Volere sub-categories
