[prem bhatkar] fit criterion ok to me.
[Andy Russell] Looks great to me.
[Iain Sproat] Looks good, thought I'm not entirely clear on the phrase 'enter a specified number'.  Do you mean the number/value of the duration?  And by 'select a specified time period', you mean select whether that number is days/weeks/months etc.?
[Steven Smith] Assumptions for the selected percentage and time period would be useful.
[Darren Bates] Rationale is ambiguous i.e. without delay infers immediacy?
