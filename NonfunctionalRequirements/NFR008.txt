REQ-ID: NFR008
Description: A receptionist shall be able to enter a time interval reasonably quickly
Type: Usability
Rationale: The receptionist will need to find an appropriate date for the patient’s next appointment quickly
Fit Criterion: Eighty percent of a panel that is representative of the receptionists will be able to enter details of a specified time interval (entering a number and selecting a time period from a choice of 'days', 'weeks' or 'months') within 15 seconds.
Originator: Steven Malley
Comments: relates to REQ-ID016 (The system shall accept the time interval (in days, weeks or months) before the next appointment)
Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
History:
v2
Rationale wording changed from 'without delay' to 'quickly' as per Darren's comment.
Fit criterion rewritten to clarify the 'specified number' and time period. The reason the test should involve a 'specified time interval' is to mimic reality, where the receptionists will have to enter the time period suggested by the therapist. 
Description changed to read 'time interval' instead of 'time period', as the phrase 'time period' is used in the fit criterion with a different meaning.

[prem bhatkar] fit criterion ok to me.
[Andy Russell] Looks great to me.
[Iain Sproat] Looks good, thought I'm not entirely clear on the phrase 'enter a specified number'.  Do you mean the number/value of the duration?  And by 'select a specified time period', you mean select whether that number is days/weeks/months etc.?
[Steven Smith] Assumptions for the selected percentage and time period would be useful.
[Darren Bates] Rationale is ambiguous i.e. without delay infers immediacy?
[Dean Armitage] Nothing further to add
[Alvaro Acevedo] Isn't this requirement clashing with REQ-ID: NFR-014
[Emma Hastings] Looks good, like idea of using a representative panel. I agree with Iain though that specified number is a bit unclear
[Lisa Li] Nothing further to add
[Steven Malley] v2 changes made after the above comments
[Joseph Souter] Description and fit criterion both look good.
[Mohammed Ngum] All looks well.
