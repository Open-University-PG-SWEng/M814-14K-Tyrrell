Added an extra comment
Updated requirement: now a real look and feel, increased selecction time for fit criterion so that it is more realistic

[prem bhatkar] 5 secs 100% of the time? or is it a measure of accuracy, 90% of the time the correct therapist should be selected
[Andy Russell] 'Large clear font' suggests a solution. Need to allow for some failure or delay.
[Iain Sproat] This suggests a solution.  I assume the 5 seconds is based on an able-bodied individual carrying out the test? (and not a blind person using a screen reader, which may take longer than 5 seconds without being a failure of the system).  Is 5 sec the mean, median or 95th percentile of a normal distribution etc.?
[Steven Smith] You would want the correct therapist to be selected 100% of the time. Assumptions for the deciding on 5 seconds would be useful.
[Darren Bates] I don't think it needs a time to select e.g. the receptionist making the appointment may be talking to the patient at the same time. Suggest adding in an amount of times this should be successful i.e. 100%. Agree more of a solution than a requirement.
[Dean Armitage] I think that the description could possibly be deemed to be solution-bound but that the rationale and fit criterion both avoid this. I agree that there should be some leeway in the response time.
[Alvaro Acevedo] Not sure if the scale used in the fit criterion is relevant to the type of requirement. Additionally  It will be nice to have the type of font / police and size, to better understand what 'in a large clear font' means.
[Steven Malley] This fit criterion seems more like a usability requirement than 'Look and feel'.
[Joseph Souter] Could do with a percentage of times, as users could make mistakes which would cause this to fail (misclicks).
[Mohammed Ngum] Slight typo in the Description ("be" is missing after shall). Fit criterion should indicate target audience. e.g. computer literate.
[Gerard Corrigan] Fit Criterion is for a performance requirement, it should be something like therapist is correctly selected 98% of the time.
[Shunsuke Yanome]I think within 5 seconds is better for this requirement.
