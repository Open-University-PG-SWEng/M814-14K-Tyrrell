REQ-ID: NFR-002
Description: The product shall be quick in determining the free appointment slots for a therapist
Type: 12
Rationale: So that the users can be efficient in their work
Fit Criterion: For 90 percent of the attempts, the product shall take no longer than 3 seconds to determine the free appointment slots for a therapist. And never take more than 10 seconds.
Fit Criterion_V2: For 90 percent of the attempts, the product shall take no longer than 3 seconds (from when user submits request) to determine the free appointment slots for a therapist for a period of 2-4 weeks in the future. And never take more than 10 seconds.
Comments:[MN] Non-functional requirement associated with functional requirement 002
Assumption1: A survey in the clinic concluded that a waiting period of less than 3 seconds in determining free appointment slots would make staff very efficient in their work. 
Between 4 to 10 seconds would make them reasonably efficient.And more than 10 seconds would make them inefficient.
Assumption2:90 percent of patients look for appointments within a 2-4 weeks in the future.

Comments:Assumption added post feedback from the group

[prem bhatkar] where do the numbers in fit criterion come from? (agreed?) assumptions? other systems? etc 
[Andy Russell] For the information we have and as we can't interview (the ficticious) the stake holders so we can't get empirical data, I'd say this looks fine to me.
[Iain Sproat] The period in which the free appointment slots are determined should be constrained.  i.e. 'determine the free appointment slots in a defined day/week for a therapist'.  If the system has to calculate over a long time period it may not pass the test.
[Steven Smith] Stating the assumptions for the selected percentages and time limits would be useful.  However, they seem like reasonable assumptions based on limited information.
[Darren Bates] Agree, with the information we have to hand the criterion is acceptable, however perhaps to help testing it could be expanded to say something like for every 50 (for example) attempts
[Dean Armitage] Nothing further to add
[Alvaro Acevedo] OK for me, will be nice to have a history of how the team came to the agreement of the range (between 3 and 10 seconds).
[Steven Malley] These targets seem fine to me.
[Emma Hastings] Reasonable fit criterion, agree that maybe some supporting information on how 3-10secs was determined would be good. Rationale seems a bit broad.
[Lisa Li] additonal infomation should be 3-10 seconds from onclick of a search button to the appointment slots return ?
[James Birkley] Looks okay with a reasonable range for the retreval of data.
[Joseph Souter] Description and fit criterion are valid (again maybe information for where time and % come from). Rationale could be expanded.
[Mohammed Ngum] Assumption added after the above feedback
[Gerard Corrigan] The type should be actual type and not the number 12, so stakeholders etc. reveiwing the requirments can understand what tyope it is. Agree with the rest of the requirement.
[Shunsuke Yanome] Determing userbility (3-10 seconds) is good for me.
