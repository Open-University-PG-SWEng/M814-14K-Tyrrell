[prem bhatkar] where do the numbers in fit criterion come from? (agreed?) assumptions? other systems? etc 
[Andy Russell] For the information we have and as we can't interview (the ficticious) the stake holders so we can't get empirical data, I'd say this looks fine to me.
[Iain Sproat] The period in which the free appointment slots are determined should be constrained.  i.e. 'determine the free appointment slots in a defined day/week for a therapist'.  If the system has to calculate over a long time period it may not pass the test.
[Steven Smith] Stating the assumptions for the selected percentages and time limits would be useful.  However, they seem like reasonable assumptions based on limited information.
[Darren Bates] Agree, with the information we have to hand the criterion is acceptable, however perhaps to help testing it could be expanded to say something like for every 50 (for example) attempts
[Dean Armitage] Nothing further to add
[Alvaro Acevedo] OK for me, will be nice to have a history of how the team came to the agreement of the range (between 3 and 10 seconds).
[Steven Malley] These targets seem fine to me.
[Emma Hastings] Reasonable fit criterion, agree that maybe some supporting information on how 3-10secs was determined would be good. Rationale seems a bit broad.
[James Birkley] Looks okay with a reasonable range for the retreval of data.
