REQ-ID: NFR005-DA
Description: The product shall allow date entry  only through a date selection mechanism. Free-format date entry shall not be permitted.
Type:10 Look and Feel
     11 Usability and Humanity
Rationale:Different users may attempt to enter dates in differing formats. Restricting date entry to a date selection mechanism ensures consistency of date formatting.
Fit Criterion: Whenever the product is focussed on a date entry field, a date selection mechanism shall be presented to the user allowing the user to select a date. The mechanism shall allow the user to scroll through months and years or key in the same to allow the date selection mechanism to focus on a specific month. Free-format entry of dates will not be possible.
