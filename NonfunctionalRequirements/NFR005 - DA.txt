REQ-ID: NFR005-DA
Description: The product shall allow date entry  only through a date selection mechanism. Free-format date entry shall not be permitted.
Type:10 Look and Feel
     11 Usability and Humanity
Rationale:Different users may attempt to enter dates in differing formats. Restricting date entry to a date selection mechanism ensures consistency of date formatting.
Fit Criterion: 100% of the times that the product requires a user to provide a date, a date selection mechanism shall be presented allowing the user to select a date.
Originator:Dean Armitage [DA]

[prem bhatkar] agree with fit criterion 
[Andy Russell] I think we're at risk of suggesting a solution, as it mentions scrolling through date and a date entry field. I think this should be left until implementation of the product.
[Iain Sproat] I agree with Andy's comments, it might constrain acceptance to a particular solution.  The method of complying with the fit criterion should be as open as possible.  There may be different mechanisms for entering dates used by disabled users, blind people etc., which should be possible to be accepted as valid solutions.
[Steven Smith] I also agree that this appears to be offering a solution as opposed to specifing a numeric method of measuring the quality of this requirement.
[Darren Bates] Difficult requirement as this appears to have the constraint 'no manual data entry' so solution has to be a date selection mechanism. Fit criterion to me is ok.
[Alvaro Acevedo] I'm afraid this requirement is to tie to the solution
[Steven Malley] The fit criterion reads more like an extended description. It should have some kind of scale to measure success. Something like "100% of entered dates are in the accepted format".
[Lisa Li]I agree with Alvaro, the requirement description seems to tie to the solution. Could it be better to describe as "The product shall provide user friendly date entry"?
[James Birkley] Two requirements have been specified in the description, backed up by having two types (10 & 11).
[Joseph Souter] As others have mentioned description is too close to a solution. Fit criterion is good though.
[Mohammed Ngum] Generally i think this requirement goes too much into technology thus fit criterion and rationale are limiting in terms of possible solutions.
[Gerard Corrigan] Description, Rationale and Fit Criterion all suggest a possible solution.
