REQ-ID: NFR-016
Description: The system shall produce the patients artefact as quickly as possible. 
Type: Performance 
Rationale: The patient will have already spent some time at the receptionists desk therefore it is important
           they receive their artefact as a quickly as possible after agreeing their next appointment time.
Fit Criterion: The time to create the artefact should be no longer than 1 minute from agreement on the next appointment.
Originator: Gerard Corrigan
Comments: [Gerard Corrigan] I am assuming that the patient will be receiving a physical artefact like a printed appointment card.
                            Since all the information is in the system 1 minute should be ample to produce the artefact.


[Joseph Souter] Could add a % of cases (e.g. in 95% of times), as there could be delays for various reasons. Description could change as all systems will try to do things as quickly as possible (even if it it slow).
