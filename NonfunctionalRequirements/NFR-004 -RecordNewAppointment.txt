Originator: Receptionist

[prem bhatkar] why 2 seconds and 98%? what the upper allowable boundary for the remaining 2%?
[Andy Russell] Agree we need to know what should happen in the other 2% of cases.
[Iain Sproat] I assume this is 2 seconds from the user pressing a 'submit' button with fully valid data already entered into the form?
[Iain Sproat] I assume the required response in this test should be either 'accepted' or 'rejected' (with the reason for rejection); error messages or holding messages (e.g. 'processing request') are presumably not responses from the system which we would want to be accepted by the fit criterion.
[Steven Smith] I agree with Iain that the description of recording with 2 seconds isn't clear as to wether this is 2 seconds for data entry or 2 seconds for writing to a database.
[Darren Bates] I don't think it is that unambiguous as it states 'when saving the new appointment' which infers data entry has been completed. I would suggest adding for test purposes a stated number of new appointments (say 100 as if you get 98 it passes)
