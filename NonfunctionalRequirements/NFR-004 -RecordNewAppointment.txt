REQ-ID: NFR004
Description: The system shall record a new appointment booking within 2 seconds.
Type: 12 - Performance
Rationale: To provide a seamless user experience when booking a new appointment.
Fit Criterion: The response from the system when saving the new appointment must be within 2 second for 98 percent of the requests.
Revised Fit Criterion: For 100 requests, at least 98 receive responses from the system within 2 seconds. And never take more than 10 seconds.
Originator: Receptionist

[prem bhatkar] why 2 seconds and 98%? what the upper allowable boundary for the remaining 2%?
[Andy Russell] Agree we need to know what should happen in the other 2% of cases.
[Iain Sproat] I assume this is 2 seconds from the user pressing a 'submit' button with fully valid data already entered into the form?
[Iain Sproat] I assume the required response in this test should be either 'accepted' or 'rejected' (with the reason for rejection); error messages or holding messages (e.g. 'processing request') are presumably not responses from the system which we would want to be accepted by the fit criterion.
[Steven Smith] I agree with Iain that the description of recording with 2 seconds isn't clear as to wether this is 2 seconds for data entry or 2 seconds for writing to a database.
[Darren Bates] I don't think it is that unambiguous as it states 'when saving the new appointment' which infers data entry has been completed. I would suggest adding for test purposes a stated number of new appointments (say 100 as if you get 98 it passes)
[Dean Armitage] As this is about system response time, I don't think that it matters whether the response is 'accepted' or 'rejected'.
[Alvaro Acevedo] Small typo in the description, should be '2 seconds'. I would suggest to revisit the rational to make it clear that this is about performing the saving data on the system
[Steven Malley] I agree with Darren that the fit criterion should be expressed in terms of a test. Something like 'Out of 100 requests to save a new appointment, at least 98 receive responses from the system within 2 seconds.'
[Joseph Souter] Clarification from when the two second period should start in the description (not just mentioned in the Fit Criterion).
