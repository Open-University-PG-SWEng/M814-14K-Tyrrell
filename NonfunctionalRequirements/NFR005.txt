REQ-ID:005
Description:The system will identify available sessions quickly.
Type:Performance
Rationale:Patients do not want to have to wait a long time before an appointment can be
made or re-arranged.
Fit Criterion:The user shall be able to identify available sessions within 2 seconds
Originator:Receptionist
Comments: [CR]

[prem bhatkar] 2 secs 100% of the time? doesnt leave room for failure
[Andy Russell] Agree we need to allow for outliers.
[Iain Sproat] Is 2 seconds the mean, median or 95% percentile of a normal distribution? (i.e. what about outliers as Prem & Andy have pointed out)
[Iain Sproat] Over what duration will available sessions be identified; on a particular day, week or other time frame?  If the system is searching over an undefined time frame it may never finish calculating!
[Iain Sproat] The fit criterion might be changed to instead shift focus from 'the user' to the system e.g. 'the system shall display'.  It currently seems to test the ability of the user, rather than the performance of the system.
[Iain Sproat] Also this has a clashing NFR ID number with another NFR005.
[Steven Smith] Is failure something we need to be considering.  We are looking for fitness criterion.  Do we need to allow for outliers?
[Darren Bates] I would suggest adding in a % (between 2 and 5%) to be no longer than 5 seconds
[Dean Armitage] Nothing further to add
[Alvaro Acevedo] All review comments above are relevant
[Steven Malley] I agree with the suggestions above.
[Emma Hastings] Agree with above. Should rationale include a mention of receptionists?
[Lisa Li] Agree the fit criterion need to be more measurable.
[James Birkley] The requirement should use the work "shall" instead of "will" in the description
