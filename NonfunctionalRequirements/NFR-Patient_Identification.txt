REQ-ID: NFR102
Description: The product shall identify a patient fast enough.
Type: Non-Functional - Performance
Rationale: When the system receives a signal to uniquely identify a patient, the response should be fast to avoid interrupting user's flow process.
Fit Criterion: The response from the system when identifying a patient must be less than 5 seconds for 95 percent of the requests and in any case no more than 10 seconds
Originator: Carol, Office Manager 
Comments: [AlvaroAcevedo]
Assumption: Assuming that previous discussions with stakeholders, a decision has taken to clarify the maximun time a user may wait 
            before the system recognises patient identity is 5 seconds, with 
            a tolerance between 5 and 10 seconds for only 5 % of the requests.

+ Update type of requirement to Performance
+ Add comments on how the requirement came to limit the response of the system to identify a patient


[prem bhatkar] fit criterion ok to me.
[Andy Russell] agree this looks fine.
[Iain Sproat] What is a suitable response?  accepted?, rejected, with the reason for rejected?  Probably not a holding response e.g. 'processing your request', nor a system error message.
[Iain Sproat] Aside, the NFR ID clashes with the other NFR002.
[Steven Smith] On what assumptions did you decide 5 seconds, 95 percent and no more than 10 seconds?
[Darren Bates] Suggest type refers to type of NFR no just NF? Aside from that fit criterion ok
[Dean Armitage] Nothing further to add
[Steven Malley] Might be slightly ambiguous: presumably 'identify a patient' means something like 'allow access to a patient's data'?
[Lawrence Craft] Iain, I believe the acceptable responses should be captured in a separate requirement. This requirement solely deals with performance. In my opinion, the fit criteria look OK for this atomic peice of system behavior.
[Lisa Li] It is fine to me.
