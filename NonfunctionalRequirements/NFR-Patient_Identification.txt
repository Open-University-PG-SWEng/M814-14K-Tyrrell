REQ-ID:NFR002
Description: The product shall identify a patient fast enough.
Type: Non-Functional
Rationale: When the system receives a signal to  uniquely identify a patient, the response should be fast to avoid interrupting user's flow process.
Fit Criterion: The response from the system when identifying a patient must be less than 5 seconds for 95 percent of the requests and in any case no more than 10 seconds

[prem bhatkar] fit criterion ok to me.
[Andy Russell] agree this looks fine.
[Iain Sproat] What is a suitable response?  accepted?, rejected, with the reason for rejected?  Probably not a holding response e.g. 'processing your request', nor a system error message.
[Iain Sproat] Aside, the NFR ID clashes with the other NFR002.
[Steven Smith] On what assumptions did you decide 5 seconds, 95 percent and no more than 10 seconds?
[Darren Bates] Suggest type refers to type of NFR no just NF? Aside from that fit criterion ok
