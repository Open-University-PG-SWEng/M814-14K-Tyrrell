Comments: 

[Iain Sproat]  What level and duration of training for the user?  Is 'trained user' necessary if the criteria is for 'the first time they use the system without any help'?  What percentage of attempts are expected within 15 seconds?  What about outliers?
[Steven Smith] Why 15 seconds? What assumptions is this based on?
[Darren Bates] Agree, I would suggest adding something in that states something like 'with 10 mintues of training on system correct payment type to be selected 95% of time', or remove trained user from fit criterion
[Dean Armitage] Nothing further to add
[Alvaro Acevedo] What 'A trained user' means? I would be nice to describe it. Also shouldn't the Fit criterion defines a range of time (e.g. 15 seconds and 20 for unaccustomed patients)
