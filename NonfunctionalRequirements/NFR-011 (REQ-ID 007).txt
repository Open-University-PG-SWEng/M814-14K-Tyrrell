Comments: 

[Iain Sproat]  What level and duration of training for the user?  Is 'trained user' necessary if the criteria is for 'the first time they use the system without any help'?  What percentage of attempts are expected within 15 seconds?  What about outliers?
[Steven Smith] Why 15 seconds? What assumptions is this based on?
[Darren Bates] Agree, I would suggest adding something in that states something like 'with 10 mintues of training on system correct payment type to be selected 95% of time', or remove trained user from fit criterion
[Dean Armitage] Nothing further to add
[Alvaro Acevedo] What 'A trained user' means? I would be nice to describe it. Also shouldn't the Fit criterion defines a range of time (e.g. 15 seconds and 20 for unaccustomed patients) 
[Steven Malley] Typo in the fit criterion: 'payment time' should say 'payment type'.
[Emma Hastings] Should rationale mention receptionist who will be main user and not just customer?
[Lisa Li] who is "a trained user"? A user who used system more than 10 times? need to clarify.
[Joseph Souter] "Trained user" and "first time they use the system" seems like a contradiction. Assumed this means 100% of users (which would seem impossible).
[Mohammed Ngum] Generally, this requirement looks more like a usability requirement than a performance requirement.
