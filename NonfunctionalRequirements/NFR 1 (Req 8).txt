REQ-ID: NFR001
Description: The product shall ensure that only an authorised user has access to allow input of a completed treatment record, or amend a completed treatment record, for the identified patient
Type: Security
Rationale: To prevent unauthorised users from being able to input new patient treatment records, or amend existing patient treatment records within the product. There will be several different access levels - 1 = Admin, 2 = Read/Write, 3 = Read Only 
Fit Criterion: For 25 completed treatment records, none of the records will be from any other user other than Level 1 (admin) or Level 2 (receptionist). A user of level 3 access will be able to read the treatment record e.g. therapist, but not input a record, or amend an existing record

v0.2 - Amended description to make clearer, and added access levels to rationale. Reduced test coverage to 25 records to reduce time in creating test data

[Prem Bhatkar] 100 records as a test or 100% records on an ongoing basis.
[Andy Russell] I think this should be 100% of records during testing.
[Iain Sproat] Therapist may also be a role which requires access to the record.  The words 'will be from' in the fit criterion seems to suggest it tests the creator of the records only, not updaters of records; perhaps different wording?
[Steven Smith]  Would the patients need a security level? Where does the figure 100 come from?
[Dean Armitage] The Description seems ambiguous. Are we looking at access (including read only) or insert/update functionality. What does 'from anyone' mean?
[Alvaro Acevedo] Not sure if this requirement is bringing benefits to the appointment system, yes the appointments system will interact with the treatment record but is limited to passing information
[Steven Malley] An alternate test might be to check that all attempts to input treatment record details fail when the user has insufficient privileges. The access rights for all authorisation levels need to be documented as well.
[Emma Hastings] I find the description a bit unclear, I thought of rewording as: "The product shall ensure that only an authorised user can input a treatment record or access completed treatment record details for the identified patient". Somewhere in the supporting material it may be good to define the different access levels in more detail.
[Lisa Li] I am not sure the fit criterion meaning, can the system hold a 50% completed treatment record, if so can everyone access that record as it is no a completed treatment record.
[James Birkley] The description looks like a combination of two requirements, making it a bit ambiguous.
[Joseph Souter] 100 Records in a test seems extreme here. This level of testing could lead to an extreme test length. Also more clarity is needed on description of who can access data.
[Mohammed Ngum] Fit criterion should be clearer in terms of testing the input of new patient treatment records and amending existing patient treatment records.
[Gerard Corrigan] The description is too long and seems to include two requirments, one to input a record and one to ammend it. The rationale includes a possible solution, the requirement should be independant of the solution.
[Shunsuke Yanome] I think fit criterion is that tesing cases should be passed 100 %.
