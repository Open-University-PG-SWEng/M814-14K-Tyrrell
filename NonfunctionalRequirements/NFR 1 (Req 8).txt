REQ-ID: NFR001
Description: The product shall ensure that only an authorised user has access to input or completed treatment record details for the identified patient
Type: Security
Rationale: To prevent unauthorised users from being able to input new patient treatment records, or amend existing patient treatment records within the product
Fit Criterion: For 100 completed treatment records, none of the records will be from anyone other than Level 1 (admin) or Level 2 (receptionist)
Originator: Office Manager
Comments: [Darren Bates]

[Prem Bhatkar] 100 records as a test or 100% records on an ongoing basis.
[Andy Russell] I think this should be 100% of records during testing.
[Iain Sproat] Therapist may also be a role which requires access to the record.  The words 'will be from' in the fit criterion seems to suggest it tests the creator of the records only, not updaters of records; perhaps different wording?
[Steven Smith]  Would the patients need a security level? Where does the figure 100 come from?
[Dean Armitage] The Description seems ambiguous. Are we looking at access (including read only) or insert/update functionality. What does 'from anyone' mean?
[Alvaro Acevedo] Not sure if this requirement is bringing benefits to the appointment system, yes the appointments system will interact with the treatment record but is limited to passing information
