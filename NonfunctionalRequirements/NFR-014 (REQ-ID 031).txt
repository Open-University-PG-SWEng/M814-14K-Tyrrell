REQ-ID: NFR-014
Description: The time taken to input completed treatment should be relatively small. 
Type: Usability 
Rationale: The receptionists and therapists are busy and the patient should not be at the practice for any longer than necessary.  Reducing the time taken to input data will facilitate both.
Fit Criterion: The time taken to input treatment should take no longer than 5 minutes.
Originator: Steven Smith
Comments: [Steven Smith]  I am assuming that 5 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to input the data and keep the patient waiting.

[Iain Sproat] Should the time be compared to the paper based system?  Is there a risk that the staff will fall back to the existing (presumably paper-based) system if the time taken to enter details in the new system is relatively longer?  What percentage of attempts should be faster than 5 minutes?  Is there an absolute limit for all outliers?
[Darren Bates] I would suggest adding a measurement of treatment entered during test meet 5 minutes or under (maybe a %?), if during test it takes 6 minutes for 10% it would indicate the system is failing in its usability
