REQ-ID: NFR-014
Description: The time taken to input completed treatment should be relatively small. 
Type: Usability 
Rationale: The receptionists and therapists are busy and the patient should not be at the practice for any longer than necessary.  Reducing the time taken to input data will facilitate both.
Fit Criterion: The time taken to input treatment should take no longer than 5 minutes.
Originator: Steven Smith
Comments: [Steven Smith]  I am assuming that 5 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to input the data and keep the patient waiting.
