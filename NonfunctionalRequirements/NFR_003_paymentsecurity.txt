REQ-ID: NFR003
Description: The product shall retain a record of the user who initiated the payment
Type: Security
Rationale: To retain information about the current user to ensure they cannot later deny initiating a payment transaction if an audit occurs
Fit Criterion: 100% of payment transactions should have the current user recorded
Originator: Carol, office manager
Comments: [Emma Hastings] creator
	  
[Prem Bhatkar] fit criterion ok for me.
[Andy Russell] FC looks fine to me too, maybe the rationale could include that we probably need to legally record who made a payment
[Iain Sproat]  The fit criterion appears to a continuous test for during live release of the product.  Perhaps setting parameters for the number of attempts would assist testing prior to acceptance?  Also, there may be a case (disabled users etc.) where a different user, perhaps the receptionist, enters the payment details on behalf of the user.
[Steven Smith] Recording the current user that initiates a payment transaction is OK.  In response to Iain's comment, only one user can initiate the payment, so the initaiting user would appear to be appropriate.
