REQ-ID: NFR06 -> REQ-ID: 032 - The product will display specific therapist schedule
Description: The product will only display specific therapists schedules to authorised members of staff.
Type: Security
Rationale: Staff are permitted to access all data on the system, where as patients can only access their own information.
Fit Criterion: The system authenticates the authorised member of staff and grants them access to the therapist schedule (and does not grant access to non-authorised members of staff).
Originator: [M814-JS] Joseph Souter

[prem bhatkar] fit criterion ok for me
[Andy Russell] Agreed it looks fine.
[Iain Sproat] Should there be numeric criteria as part of the FC?  e.g. of x requests, x will be from authorised....  Or, vice versa - of x attempts zero will be from non-authorised...
[Steven Smith] I agree with Iain on trying to achieve a numeric criteria.  However, as this is a security requirement, you could argue that the fit criteria should be for 100% correct authentication.  You wouldn't feel the requirement was fit if it only authenticated successfully 95% of the time.
[Darren Bates] Agree with Iain and Steven
[Dean Armitage] I think that the fit criterion gives an indication that 100% of access attempts by unauthorized users will be rejected but that this should be explicitly stated.
[Alvaro Acevedo] Ok for me
[Steven Malley] Looks good to me.
[Emma] Fit criterion is ok for me. Should rationale specifically mention schedule data as opposed to all data and should it mention patients at all?
